This directory contains the code to run backdoor attack on CIFAR-10. The backdoor attack algorithm is implemented based on [BadNets: Identifying Vulnerabilities in the Machine Learning Model Supply Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06733).

## Setup

If you're using conda, create environment `badnets` by
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
